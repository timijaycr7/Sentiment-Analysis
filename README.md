# 💬 Sentiment Analysis Using BERT
# Overview

This project implements a sentiment analysis system using a pre-trained BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model to classify text into sentiment categories such as positive, negative, and neutral.

The notebook demonstrates an end-to-end natural language processing (NLP) pipeline  from text preprocessing and tokenization to fine-tuning a transformer model and evaluating its performance.

The goal is to leverage state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to achieve high accuracy in understanding human emotions and opinions from text data.
